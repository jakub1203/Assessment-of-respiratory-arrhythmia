# Hypertension: Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA) Assessment in Healthy Individuals and People with Arterial Hypertension
This repository contains code for analyzing respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) in healthy individuals and people with arterial hypertension. The following analyses are included:

Completeness of the series
Visualization of the series
Stationarity of the series
Basic statistics
Value histograms
Series dependency on time
Poincar√© plots
Determination of the temporal properties of RR intervals: SDNN, RMSSD, pNN50, pNN20
Search for patterns (symbolic properties of the signal):
The number of R peaks during inhalation and exhalation
The number of accelerations and decelerations of the heart rhythm during inhalation and exhalation
The number of increases and decreases in systolic blood pressure (SBP) during inhalation and exhalation
Determination of the temporal properties of blood pressure signals: mean systolic pressure
Division of the respiratory waveform into inhalations and exhalations
Group characteristics of the above features
